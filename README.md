# Scattering covariance transform on the sphere

`S2SCAT` is a Python package for computing third generation scattering covariances on the 
sphere [(Mousset et al 2024)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14670) using 
JAX or PyTorch. It leverages autodiff to provide differentiable transforms, which are 
also deployable on hardware accelerators (e.g. GPUs and TPUs).

> [!TIP]
At launch `S2SCAT` also provides PyTorch implementations of underlying 
precompute transforms. In future releases this support will be extended to our 
on-the-fly algorithms. `S2SCAT` also provides JAX frontend support for the highly optimised 
but CPU bound SSHT C backends. These can be useful when GPU resources are not available or 
memory constraints are tight.


## Third Generation Scattering Covariances :zap:

Details about the transform here with nice animations!


## Installation :computer:

The Python dependencies for the `S2SCAT` package are listed in the file
`requirements/requirements-core.txt` and will be automatically installed
into the active python environment by [pip](https://pypi.org) when running

``` bash
pip install s2scat
```
This will install all core functionality which includes JAX support (including PyTorch support).

Alternatively, the `S2SCAT` package may be installed directly from GitHub by cloning this 
repository and then running 

``` bash
pip install .        
```

from the root directory of the repository. 

Unit tests can then be executed to ensure the installation was successful by first installing the test requirements and then running pytest

``` bash
pip install -r requirements/requirements-tests.txt
pytest tests/  
```

Documentation for the released version is available [here](https://astro-informatics.github.io/s2scat/).  To build the documentation locally run

``` bash
pip install -r requirements/requirements-docs.txt
cd docs 
make html
open _build/html/index.html
```

## Usage :rocket:

To import and use `S2SCAT` is as simple follows:

``` python
Code example here. 
```

For further details on usage see the [documentation](https://astro-informatics.github.io/s2scat/) 
and associated [notebooks](add_link_here).

> [!NOTE]  
> We also provide PyTorch support for the precompute version of our transforms. These 
> are called through forward/inverse_torch(). Full PyTorch support will be provided in 
> future releases.

## C/C++ JAX Frontends for SSHT/HEALPix :bulb:

`S2SCAT` also provides JAX support for existing C backend libraries which are memory efficient 
but CPU bound; at launch we support [`SSHT`](https://github.com/astro-informatics/ssht), 
however this could be extended straightforwardly. This works by wrapping python bindings 
with custom JAX frontends.

For example, one may call these alternate backends for the spherical harmonic transform by:

``` python
Code example here. 
```

All of these JAX frontends supports out of the box reverse mode automatic differentiation, 
and under the hood is simply linking to the C/C++ packages you are familiar with. In this 
way `S2SCAT` supports existing backend transforms with gradient functionality for modern 
scientific computing or machine learning applications!

For further details on usage see the associated [notebooks](add_link_here).
