# S2SCAT: Scattering covariance transform on the sphere

<img align="center" src="./docs/assets/synthesis_zoom.gif">

`S2SCAT` is a Python package for computing third generation scattering covariances on the sphere [(Mousset et al 2024)](https://arxiv.org/abs/xxxx.xxxxx) using JAX. It leverages autodiff to provide differentiable transforms, which are also deployable on hardware accelerators (e.g. GPUs and TPUs). Scattering covariances are useful both for field-level emulation of complex non-Gaussian textures and for statistical compression of high dimensional field-level data, a key step of e.g. simulation based inference [(Cranmer et al 2020)](https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.1912789117).

> [!TIP]
> At launch `S2SCAT` provides JAX frontend support for the highly optimised but CPU bound SSHT C backends. These can be useful when GPU resources are not available or memory constraints are tight.


## Third Generation Scattering Statistics :dna:

<img align="right" width="300" height="300" src="./docs/assets/synthesis.gif">

Scattering covariances, or scattering spectra, were previously introduced for 1D signals by [Morel et al (2023)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.10177) and for planar 2D signals by [Cheng et al (2023)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.17210). The scattering transform is defined by repeated application of directional wavelet transforms followed by a machine learning inspired non-linearity, typically the modulus operator. The wavelet transform $W^{\lambda}$ within each layer has an associated scale $j$ and direction $n$, which we group into a single label $\lambda$. Scattering covariances $S$ are computed from the coefficients of a two-layer scattering transform and are defined as

$$S_1^{\lambda_1} = \langle |W^{\lambda_1} I| \rangle \quad S_2^{\lambda_1} = \langle|W^{\lambda_1} I|^2 \rangle$$

$$S_3^{\lambda_1, \lambda_2} = \text{Cov} \left[  W^{\lambda_1}I, W^{\lambda_1}|W^{\lambda_2} I| \right]$$

$$S_4^{\lambda_1, \lambda_2, \lambda_3} = \text{Cov} \left[W^{\lambda_1}|W^{\lambda_3}I|, W^{\lambda_1}|W^{\lambda_2}I|\right].$$

Given that the highest order coefficients are computed from products between $\lambda_1, \lambda_2$ and $\lambda_3$ they encode $6^{\text{th}}$-order statistical information. This statistical representation characterises the power and sparsity at given scales, as well as covariant features between different wavelet scale and directions; which can adequetly capture complex non-Gaussian structural information, e.g. filamentary structure. Using recently release JAX spherical harmonic [(Price & McEwen 2023)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14670) and wavelet transforms [(Price et al 2024)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01282) this work extends scattering covariances to the sphere, which is necessary for their application to e.g. wide-field cosmological surveys [(Mousset et al 2024)](https://arxiv.org/abs/xxxx.xxxxx).

## Installation :computer:

The Python dependencies for the `S2SCAT` package are listed in the file
`requirements/requirements-core.txt` and will be automatically installed
into the active python environment by [pip](https://pypi.org) when running

``` bash
pip install s2scat
```
This will install all core functionality which includes full JAX support.

Alternatively, the `S2SCAT` package may be installed directly from GitHub by cloning this 
repository and then running 

``` bash
pip install .        
```

from the root directory of the repository. 

Unit tests can then be executed to ensure the installation was successful by first installing the test requirements and then running pytest

``` bash
pip install -r requirements/requirements-tests.txt
pytest tests/  
```

Documentation for the released version is available [here](https://astro-informatics.github.io/s2scat/).

## Usage :rocket:

To import and use `S2SCAT` is as simple follows:

``` python
import s2scat, s2wav
L = _   # Harmonic bandlimit 
N = _   # Azimuthal bandlimit 
flm = _ # Harmonic coefficients of the input signal 

# Core GPU transforms 
config = s2scat.configure(L, N)
covariances = s2scat.scatter(flm, L, N, config=config)

# C backend CPU transforms
config = s2scat.configure(L, N, c_backend=True)
covariances = s2scat.scatter_c(flm, L, N, config=config)
```
`S2SCAT` also provides JAX support for existing C backend libraries which are memory efficient but CPU bound; at launch we support [`SSHT`](https://github.com/astro-informatics/ssht), however this could be extended straightforwardly. This works by wrapping python bindings with custom JAX frontends.

For further details on usage see the [documentation](https://astro-informatics.github.io/s2scat/) and associated [notebooks](add_link_here).
