Differentiable scattering covariances on the sphere
=================================================================================================================

``S2SCAT`` is a Python package for computing third generation scattering covariances on the 
sphere `(Mousset et al 2024) <https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14670>`_ using 
JAX or PyTorch. It leverages autodiff to provide differentiable transforms, which are 
also deployable on hardware accelerators (e.g. GPUs and TPUs).
